# QTrackr (Translink-SEQ Bot)
## A Product by Imogen of SEQTA.

This is a work-in-progress timetable bot for Discord.
The bot is supposed to pull the Translink SEQ GTFS data and present it in a neat and usable format.
*There is still a lot to get done*

Thanks and I appreciate any contributions.


## Made with ❤️
