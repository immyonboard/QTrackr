# Translink Tracker
## A Product by Imogen of SEQTA.

This is a very work-in-progress timetable bot for Discord.
The bot is supposed to pull the Translink SEQ GTFS data and present it in a neat and usable format.
*There is still a lot to get done*

# Known Bugs: 🐜
- Bot will only show RTT, not static.
- Very messy code
- Stop suggestions are buggy.

# Future Features (hopefully): 🤞
- Ability to pin your stop to the top of command suggestions
- In-Discord settings panel.
- Ability to pull route timetables
- Simulating PIDS

Thanks and I appreciate any contributions.


## Made with ❤️
